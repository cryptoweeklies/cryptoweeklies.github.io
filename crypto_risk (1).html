 <div id="Description">
        <p>The composite risk score system for cryptocurrencies provides a comprehensive evaluation of the risk associated with investing in different digital assets. It combines multiple risk factors, including volatility, beta, alpha, risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio), and percent drawdown, to provide investors with a holistic view of the risk-return profile of each cryptocurrency.</p>

        <p><strong>Volatility</strong> measures the degree of price fluctuations, with higher volatility implying greater risk. <strong>Beta</strong> assesses the sensitivity of a cryptocurrency's price movements relative to the broader market, rewarding moderate beta as it indicates lower correlation with market fluctuations. <strong>Alpha</strong> represents the excess return of a cryptocurrency compared to its expected return, rewarding positive alpha as it indicates outperformance.</p>

        <p><strong>Risk-adjusted returns</strong>, calculated using the Sharpe ratio, assess the return generated per unit of risk taken, rewarding higher risk-adjusted returns as they reflect better performance relative to risk. <strong>Percent drawdown</strong> measures the extent of decline in a cryptocurrency's price from its peak, with higher drawdowns indicating higher risk.</p>

        <p>By normalizing and weighting these factors, the composite risk score system produces a single metric that quantifies the overall riskiness of each cryptocurrency. Investors can use this score to compare different cryptocurrencies and make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment objectives.</p>

        <p>A <strong>higher risk score</strong> suggests higher risk, while a <strong>lower risk score</strong> indicates lower risk. Therefore, investors may prefer cryptocurrencies with lower risk scores for more conservative investment strategies, while those seeking higher returns may be willing to accept higher risk scores.</p>

        <p>Overall, the composite risk score system provides valuable insights into the risk-return trade-offs of investing in cryptocurrencies, helping investors make more informed investment decisions.</p>
