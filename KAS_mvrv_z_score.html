<h2 style='color: white;'>MVRV Z-Score Concept</h2>
<p style='color: white;'>The MVRV Z-Score is a metric used to assess the current market value of an asset relative to its historical realized value. It's calculated by taking the difference between the market value (price) and the mean realized value, and then dividing by the standard deviation of the realized value. A positive Z-Score indicates that the market value is higher than the historical average, suggesting the asset may be overvalued. Conversely, a negative Z-Score suggests undervaluation.</p>
